### Main Django Apps for the LMS

#### 1\. `accounts`

Account app would handle everything related to users and members.
  * **Purpose:** Manages user authentication, registration, and member profiles.
  * **Key Models:**
      * `MemberProfile`: A one-to-one link to Django's built-in `User` model to store additional information like Member ID, phone number, address, and account status (e.g., Active, Suspended).
  * **Core Functionalities:**
      * User registration (creating new members).
      * Login and logout.
      * Profile viewing and editing.
      * Password management.
      * Librarian/staff role management (using Django's permission system).

#### 2\. `catalog`

catalog app act as core app for managing the library's collection. It deals with all the items the library owns.

  * **Purpose:** To catalog and manage all library materials.
  * **Key Models:**
      * `Book`: Stores general information about a book like title, ISBN, publisher, publication date.
      * `Author`: To store author details and link them to books (a many-to-many relationship).
      * `Genre`: To classify books by category.
      * `BookInstance`: Represents a specific physical copy of a `Book`. It would have a status field (e.g., 'Available', 'On Loan', 'Maintenance') and a unique ID.
  * **Core Functionalities:**
      * Adding, updating, and deleting books, authors, and genres.
      * Managing individual copies (instances) of each book.
      * A powerful search interface for both librarians and members.

#### 3\. `circulation`

`circulation` app manages the interactions between members and the library's catalog—the actual borrowing and returning process.

  * **Purpose:** To handle all transactional logic like check-outs, check-ins, fines, and reservations.
  * **Key Models:**
      * `Loan`: A model to track a `BookInstance` that is loaned to a `MemberProfile`. It would store the borrow date, due date, and return date.
      * `Reservation`: A model to manage holds placed by a `MemberProfile` on a `Book`.
  * **Core Functionalities:**
      * Processing book check-outs and check-ins.
      * Automatically calculating due dates and overdue fines.
      * Managing the reservation queue for popular books.
      * Sending notifications (e.g., due date reminders).

#### 4\. `acquisitions` (Optional)

For advanced version, this app would manage the process of buying new books. For a simpler system, this functionality could be merged into the `catalog` app.

  * **Purpose:** To manage the purchasing and intake of new library materials.
  * **Key Models:**
      * `Supplier`: Information about book vendors.
      * `PurchaseOrder`: To track orders placed with suppliers.
  * **Core Functionalities:**
      * Creating and managing purchase orders.
      * Tracking budgets for new materials.
      * A workflow for receiving new books and adding them to the `catalog`.

#### 5\. `reports`

`reports` app would not have its own models but would contain the logic to query the databases of other apps to generate valuable insights.

  * **Purpose:** To provide analytics and data visualization for librarians.
  * **Key Models:** None. This app would primarily consist of views and utility functions.
  * **Core Functionalities:**
      * Generating reports on most borrowed books.
      * Displaying circulation statistics over time.
      * Creating dashboards for library staff to view key metrics.

### Project Structure Example

Your Django project, let's call it `lms_project`, would look something like this:

```

│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py

├── reports/            # App for reporting and analytics
